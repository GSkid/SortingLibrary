# SortingLibrary

This repository is intended to be a c++ library to sort vectors (other data types may follow) with a variety of sorting methods. The unit test functionality allows users to test the different sorting methods and see how fast each method runs. As an aside, I am still learning the optimal algorithms for each sorting method and will likely take some time to implement a solid library. Currently, the project is in a state where there is no .lib file; this will be changed once substantial sorting methods have been implemented.

In addition to helping me learn algorithms, this library is intended to demonstrate TDD as the tests are all written before the actual sorting method is written.
